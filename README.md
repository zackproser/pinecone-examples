# Overview

This repo contains my initial experiments while playing with Pinecone.io and working through the examples. 

# Current examples

* [Quickstart](./quickstart)
* [Langchain Retrieval Augmentation](./langchain-retrieval)

## Quickstart

![Pinecone.io Quickstart](./_docs/pinecone-quickstart.gif)

Get up and running with Pinecone.io in seconds. A runnable Python example that demonstrates: 

* Creating an Index
* Upserting some sample vectors
* Performing a query 

## Langchain Retrieval Augmentation 

![Langchain Retrieval Augmentation](./_docs/langchain-retrieval.gif)

Leverage Pinecone.io and OpenAI to quickly build a robust chatbot-like experience based on a Wikipedia dataset. 

A great way to learn about: 

* Pre-processing text
* Langchain
* OpenAI
* Pinecone.io vector databases
